# Hospital Snapshot

Dashboard Tool for Torch

The application utilizs an API to access and modify the PostgreSQL database.

Before we can use our frontend, we have to get our API up and running. Check out the readme.md file in the ./api directory on how to setup the API. 

Once the API is running, check out the readme.md file in the ./frontend directory on how to serve the frontend on the localhost.

### Note

For development purposes, we use the docker container only for running the API. It is not required to build a docker file for the frontend part of the application.
